**Sheet Name: Dropout Reasons & Recommendations (Qualitative)**

**Common Reasons for Dropout**

* **Academic Pressure & Tough Syllabi:** Extreme pressure, difficulty coping with demanding curricula, especially with pre-existing 'input gaps'.
* **Financial Constraints:** Steep fee hikes, unaffordable overall costs, and barriers to securing educational loans.
* **Social Discrimination & Integration Challenges:** Pervasive caste-based prejudice, alienation, lack of integration.
* **Mental Health Issues:** Cumulative stress, anxiety, depression, inadequate institutional support.
* **Alternative Opportunities:** Securing preferred seats elsewhere or attractive job offers (especially for PG students).
* **Lack of Institutional Support:** Ineffective or non-existent Equal Opportunity Cells (EOCs) and SC/ST Cells; poor implementation of UGC equity regulations.

**Key Recommendations**

1.  **Strengthen Foundational Support:** High-quality preparatory/remedial programs; improve school education in disadvantaged regions.
2.  **Enhance Inclusivity & Combat Discrimination:** Enforce anti-discrimination policies; mandatory caste-sensitization training; effective EOCs/SC-ST Cells; recruit diverse faculty.
3.  **Comprehensive Financial & Welfare Support:** Increase financial aid to cover full costs; culturally sensitive mental health services and academic support.
4.  **Improve Data Collection & Transparency:** Standardize and centralize disaggregated data (admissions, performance, dropouts); mandate transparent reporting.
